No, I'm not the cousin of a famous wizard you might know.

I am a video editor by day and an amateur coder, gamer, and writer by night. For now I live in Los Angeles, California. I'm on the verge of 30 years living on this rock, and I'm looking to uplevel my next decade. I like playing guitar and I dabble in piano. I'm committed to someone very cool, and I suck at Apex Legends. I've invested in crypto, forgotten the keys to my fortune, and re-invested again in the hopes of waking up rich one day. The new retirement account.

I'm out to live more comfortably than I am now, though, I never want that to be the ultimate goal. Money can never be a goal. Money is a means not an end. So what do I want to do? I've always wanted to make a mark, but have never been brave enough, committed enough, or confident to d it. Here's to changing that attitude right fucking now.
